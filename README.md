Sector Allocator

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI to inform sector allocation in investment portfolios. By extracting and analyzing financial news using FinBERT, the engine quantifies market sentiment across sectors and recommends optimal portfolio weights. Results are visualized and delivered to users through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
